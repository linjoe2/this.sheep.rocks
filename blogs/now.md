## where am i traveling now?
 at the moment my van will stay in Barcelona until June, when the festival season starts. I will be mainly staying at [my workspace](http://made-bcn.org/), where i rent office space to get busy with my projects most of the day. Need to find me at day time? on the week days this is the best spot to start looking.

## what tech am i building now?
creating my own instrument: a key-tar synthesiser with help of a Raspi including the [Synthian software](http://www.zynthian.org/).

## What Business am i running now?
As the van life has brought me so much good growth in my life and the freedom I have been craving for, I want to inspire others to get this going! In the last few months people have non stop been asking me questions about how to get going with the vanlife, so as you request, i will create! I will be recording a E-course about how to get started with the vanlife from idea to execution to the point of actually keep it going as a lifestyle.
