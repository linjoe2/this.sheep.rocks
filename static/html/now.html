<p>As the van life has brought me so much good growth in my life and the freedom I have been craving for, I want to inspire others to get this going! In the last few months people have non stop been asking me questions about how to get going with the vanlife, so as you request, i will create! I will be recording a E-course about how to get started with the vanlife from idea to execution to the point of actually keep it going as a lifestyle.</p>
